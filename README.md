# wavsfromprojects
python script that creates a webpage with links to wav files and flps found in your FL Studio projects folder. Also stores notes using localstorage

Clone this repo, cd to the directory, run this command:

    python wavsfromprojects.py
	
This will scan your projects folder for wav files one level deep and create a web page with links to them as well as any flp files found alongside.  The webpage will be created in the same folder as this script.
